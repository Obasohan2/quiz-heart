## Design
## Colour Scheme

In my css file I have used variables to declare colours, and then used these throughout the css file. I was recently introduced to this method during a code institute study and had some help from slack chat room - it is a useful convention to use as it allows you to alter the colour throughout the website if you decide to update a colour, by changing the colour once in the variable.

- I used rgb(135, 206, 235) as a background colour.
- I used #333333 for heading
I have used #E6ECF0 as the button background.
I have use #c6c9cc for the hover background
I have used #fff as the text colour
I have used #001e4d;; for the button background
I have used rgb(3, 233, 103) to display the correct answer .
I have used #bb0505; to display the wrong answer .

## Manual Testing and Code Validation

- I used (https://jshint.com) [JSHint JavaScript Validator] to validate all the Javascript codes which resulted: "Document checking completed. No errors but warnings show"
- I used (https://validator.w3.org) [HTML Validator w3c] to validate all the HTML codes which resulted: "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show"
- I used (https://jigsaw.w3.org") [CSS Validator jigsaw] to validate the CSS codes to validate the CSS style codes and resulted: "Congratulations! No Error Found"
- I used the google chrome "Lighthouse" Developer Tools to test and analise with score results as follows: Performance: 88%, Accessibility: 100%, Best Practices: 96%, SEO:91%
